Calculator Project
The Calculator Project is a basic Python application that allows users to perform a variety of arithmetic operations. This project serves as a simple, yet effective way to demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills, including handling user input, performing calculations, and implementing error handling. The application is designed for use in a console environment and is a great starting point for beginners to get comfortable with Python.

Project Overview
This calculator project is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

Addition: Sum two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
Division: Divide one number by another, with error handling to manage division by zero scenarios.
The project is implemented in Python using straightforward control structures and functions, making it an ideal learning tool for new programmers. The code is structured in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to read and modify.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, covering the fundamental operations needed for most basic calculations.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to manage potential issues such as division by zero, invalid input, or unexpected user behavior.
User-Friendly Interface: The console-based interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to quickly enter their desired operations and receive results immediately.
Expandable Design: The programâ€™s structure is flexible, allowing for easy expansion to include more advanced mathematical functions such as:
Square roots
Exponentiation
Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
Logarithmic calculations
Educational Value: Ideal for beginners to understand basic programming concepts, including functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python.
Project Structure
The project is organized into a single Python script that contains all the necessary logic for performing calculations. The structure is designed to be straightforward, with separate functions handling different types of calculations and error checking. This modular approach allows for easy updates and extensions to the functionality.
